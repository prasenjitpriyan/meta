# React useState Hook

## What Can State Hold

The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!

We could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values.

> Example: Create multiple state Hooks:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Car() {
  const [brand, setBrand] = useState("Ford");
  const [model, setModel] = useState("Mustang");
  const [year, setYear] = useState("1964");
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My {brand}</h1>
      <p>
        It is a {color} {model} from {year}.
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Car />);
```

Or, we can just use one state and include an object instead!

> Example: Create a single Hook that holds an object:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Car() {
  const [car, setCar] = useState({
    brand: "Ford",
    model: "Mustang",
    year: "1964",
    color: "red",
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>
      <p>
        It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Car />);
```

## Updating Objects and Arrays in State

When state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten.

What if we only want to update the color of our car?

If we only called setCar({color: "blue"}), this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state.

We can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us.

> Example: Use the JavaScript spread operator to update only the color of the car:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Car() {
  const [car, setCar] = useState({
    brand: "Ford",
    model: "Mustang",
    year: "1964",
    color: "red",
  });

  const updateColor = () => {
    setCar((previousState) => {
      return { ...previousState, color: "blue" };
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>
      <p>
        It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.
      </p>
      <button type="button" onClick={updateColor}>
        Blue
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Car />);
```
